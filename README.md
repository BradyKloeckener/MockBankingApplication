# MockBankingApplication

This is a mock online banking application where users can view their account balance and transfer money to other users

This project was built as MySQL practice and is not intended to be used by anyone

I used MySQL, Express.Js, HTML with embedded javascript to create this project.

A config file with a database username and password is necessary. Use the bank.sqp file to create the tables for the database
